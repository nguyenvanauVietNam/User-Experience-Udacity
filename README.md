### 2. Feature Ideation
- Develop feature ideas based on research findings and then prioritize these features to determine what needs to be developed in the prototype.

### 3. Paper Sketching
- Create paper sketches to represent your design ideas. This includes techniques such as Crazy-8s and detailed sketches.

### 4. Digital Prototyping
- Convert paper sketches into digital prototypes using Figma, creating low-fidelity wireframes with basic UI elements.

### 5. Usability Research
- Conduct usability research to gather user feedback on your prototype and refine the design based on the feedback.

## Key Considerations

- **Organization and Clarity**: Ensure that the sections on your design board are organized clearly and logically. Use frames to divide different sections such as "Interview Notes", "Themes and Opportunities", "Feature Ideation", etc.

- **Detail and Conciseness**: When taking notes from interviews, make sure the information is detailed enough to understand but concise enough for easy digestion. Avoid vague notes.

- **Feedback from Usability Study**: When conducting usability research, pay attention to user feedback and insights. Use them to improve your prototype in subsequent versions.
