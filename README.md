## Project: UX Fundamentals & Design Research
This guide will help you understand the process of user research and experience design. Here are some key points you will learn from this project:

## What You Will Learn

### 1. Research Planning
- Learn how to define clear and reasonable research objectives and how to formulate key research questions.

### 2. Research Methods
- Understand various research methods, how to choose the appropriate method, and how to conduct interviews or surveys.

### 3. Question Design
- Learn how to design interview and survey questions to ensure they directly relate to research objectives.

### 4. Reporting Results
- Learn how to summarize and present findings from research, including making recommendations based on collected data.

### 5. Interface Design
- Practice designing interfaces based on research findings and design principles.

## Key Considerations

- **Clarity and Specificity**: Ensure that your research objectives and questions are clear and specific. Avoid trying to cover too much in one study.
- **Connection Between Questions and Objectives**: Make sure that your interview and survey questions are directly related to the research objectives.
- **Data Analysis**: Be sure to have a plan for analyzing data and presenting findings clearly.

## Project: Lo-Fi Rapid Prototyping

"Prototyping" focuses on creating low-fidelity prototypes to test and develop design ideas. Here are some key points you will learn from this project:

## Main Content of the Project

### 1. Research and Analysis
- Start by synthesizing data from user research, identifying themes, and design opportunities based on the collected information.

### 2. Feature Ideation
- Develop feature ideas based on research findings and then prioritize these features to determine what needs to be developed in the prototype.

### 3. Paper Sketching
- Create paper sketches to represent your design ideas. This includes techniques such as Crazy-8s and detailed sketches.

### 4. Digital Prototyping
- Convert paper sketches into digital prototypes using Figma, creating low-fidelity wireframes with basic UI elements.

### 5. Usability Research
- Conduct usability research to gather user feedback on your prototype and refine the design based on the feedback.

## Key Considerations

- **Organization and Clarity**: Ensure that the sections on your design board are organized clearly and logically. Use frames to divide different sections such as "Interview Notes", "Themes and Opportunities", "Feature Ideation", etc.

- **Detail and Conciseness**: When taking notes from interviews, make sure the information is detailed enough to understand but concise enough for easy digestion. Avoid vague notes.

- **Feedback from Usability Study**: When conducting usability research, pay attention to user feedback and insights. Use them to improve your prototype in subsequent versions.
